Hi everyone. 
This site is an alternative to obtaining the SurfG+ software. Unfortunately, the original site (http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/surfgplus/)) is no longer available.
SurfG+ is a pipeline running several other software, most non-open source. To run SurfG+, you must download and install by yourself the following software: 

//SignalP:
SurfG.signalpshort.exec = third-party-software/signalp-3.0/signalp
//HMMER
SurfG.hmm.exec = third-party-software/hmmer-2.3.2/src/hmmsearch
//LipoP
SurfG.lipop.exec = third-party-software/LipoP/LipoP
//TMMOD binary and installation directory
SurfG.tmmod.exec = third-party-software/tmmod/tmmod
SurfG.directorytmmod = third-party-software/tmmod/
//TMHMM (Optional, only if Surfg+ is launched with -TMHMM parameter)
SurfG.tmhmm.exec = third-party-software/TMHMM2.0c/bin/tmhmm

I extracted this software list from the files named SurfG.props.*. I edited these files to incorporate a path called "third-party-software ." So, it would be best if you defined a directory to install the above list of software and reference it by this path name. In Linux machines, you do not need to alter the files but create a symbolic link like this:

ln -fs /home/anderson/repos/medpipe third-party-software

Also we need a environment variable called MEDPIPE set with the path pointed by third-party-software. For instance:

export MEDPIPE=/home/anderson/repos/medpipe/; java -Xmx1024m -jar Surfg.jar -i /home/anderson/repos/non-CSPs/data/pengaroo_training_neg.faa -o /home/anderson/repos/non-CSPs/data/pengaroo_training_neg.out /home/anderson/repos/non-CSPs/data/pengaroo_training_neg.csv /home/anderson/repos/non-CSPs/data/pengaroo_training_neg.result -TMHMM -loop 100 -end 50

Also, if you want to run predictions for gram-negative bacteria, you should change the symbolic link 
ln -fs SurfG.props.gramn SurfG.props

Please ensure each of the above software runs alone and smoothly before trying to run the SurfG+.

That's all, folks.
