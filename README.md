Non-classical secreted proteins classified by machine learning

This repository contains mainly data and software to facilitate the creation of ARFF files for WEKA. Once your data is formatted to an ARFF, you can execute all software within the WEKA software. Read the methods of my article to know how to proceed. 

Besides the software to format data for WEKA, I added the pipeline SurfG+, which allows me to create a large data set (1050) negative for non-classical secreted proteins. SurfG+ is very helpful in classifing bacterial proteins according to localizations membrane (integral and partial), cytoplasm, and secreted.
